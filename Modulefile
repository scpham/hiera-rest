summary 'A Hiera REST API backend'
description 'Hiera is a configuration data store with pluggable back ends; hiera-rest is a backend written to tie into a specific configuration management database. Although this database is proprietary, you could easily use it as a base for any other REST based database by editing the queries in the restquery method. This allows you to glue Hiera to an existing database via a REST API.'
